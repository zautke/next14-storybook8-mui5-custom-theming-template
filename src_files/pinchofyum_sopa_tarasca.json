We made some small adjustments to use things on hand versus going to the store -diced  fire roasted tomatoes instead of canned, beef broth instead of veggie, and used one can of kidney and one can of pinto. Turned out fabulous and will definitely make again! DO NOT SKIP OUT ON THE CORN FRITTERS- they are the best touch."

I used some bell pepper for a peppery taste without any heat and sharp cheddar since I didn't have cotija hand. I ended up needing a couple tablespoons of water for the fritters to hold, but this is a wonderful meal.
