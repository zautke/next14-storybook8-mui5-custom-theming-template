My fine mesh strainer was so fine that none of the goodness was draining through. Instead of finding something that it would drain through I decided to dump it in a bowl and use it as is. Yeah, that doesn't work so well. The skin on the peppers is too tough. I knew better but was in a hurry. I strained it the next day and made it right again. With that being said, this is some really good sauce. It's a little on the oily side but still good. It's not as hot as you would think. It's basically like a really rich and robust homemade enchilada sauce. Excellent recipe!"
